A set of general-purpose PHP utility classes and functions

Current status
--------------
Extremely experimental. I don't recommend you use it in your own work.

"Inspired by"
-------------
Many of these functions, classes, and other ideas were stolen shamelessly from
the following libraries, packages, and languages. The reason they were forked
instead of just being pulled in via Composer is listed next to each name:

nikic/iter
~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately link:https://github.com/nikic/iter[this awesome package] is only
available for PHP 5.5+ because most of the library relies on generators.

schmittjoh/php-option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a fantastic, fantastic package that provides the `Option` class for
PHP. It marks each of the subclasses (`Some`, `None`) as `final` unfortunately,
which makes it difficult to extend. I've chosen to go with a `Failure`
/ `Success` model here instead.

Contributing
------------
- Run the tests before committing, run the tests after committing

- Run the tests before starting work

- Document every function, every method, and every class

- Document any potential exceptions being thrown

- Don't use a vanilla `Exception` class - use the most appropriate
  link:php.net/manual/en/spl.exceptions.php/[SPL Exception] or a custom
  exception if you think it's important

- Keep everything organized by PSR-4 standards

- Use PSR-2 coding conventions

- 4 spaces, not tabs. UTF-8, `\n` for newlines, no trailing spaces (check the
  .editorconfig file)

- PHPMD should pass on everything

- Don't put anything in the global namespace

- Pull requests should come from a feature branch

- Give credit in the "Inspired by" section in this document
